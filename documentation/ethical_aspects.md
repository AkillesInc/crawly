# Ethical aspects of crawling
---

It's important to be polite, when doing a web crawling. You should
avoid cases when your spiders are putting harm on the scrapped
websites. As it's mentioned here: https://blog.scrapinghub.com/2016/08/25/how-to-crawl-the-web-politely-with-scrapy#comments-listing

1. A polite crawler respects robots.txt.
2. A polite crawler never degrades a websiteâ€™s performance.
3. A polite crawler identifies its creator with contact information.
4. A polite crawler is not a pain in the buttocks of system
administrators.
